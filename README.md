This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
Welcome to the Cat app!
First, install everything you need using:

```bash
npm i

```
then: 
```bash
npm run dev
```

and go to: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the cat app.

also run 
```bash
npm run test
```
to run the few test I wrote. I did not cover the entire app, but wrote a few test to quickly demostrate roughly how I would intend to cover everything if I had more time for it.


I have also left a few //TODOs in places where I was running out of time to implement the full logic; I would be happy to go  back to it if needed though.

Enjoy!
